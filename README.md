# TicTacToe
My first app in C# - a console game TicTacToe for 2 players, created after two weeks of learning C#
Here, I used singleton for the first time, for scoreboard - class Score.
Disclaimer - I have done some web application programming in PHP and CFML about 10 yrs ago, so this is not my 1st app at all.
